# CS305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

  The client Artiemis Financial was an investment manamgement Service. The Company was needing ways to improve security within their system and for their current libraries to be scanned for different vulnerabilities.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

  I believe that what I did well was running the OWASP Dependency check to look four any outdated dependencies and then identifying them. 
  After this was done, I implemented SHA-256 to ensure the integrity of the data, and I also incorporated HTTPS. It is important to code securely as it helps to prevent any data breaches, this helps to build trust with the customers.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  The most helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was the use of the OWASP Dependency check as it greatly helped to indentify any vulnerabilities easily.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  I increased the layers of security by incorporating SHA-256, implementing HTTPS, and by running dependency checks. In the future I woul run more dynamic testing.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  I made sure the code was functional by running test on the code to ensure that each part was working in the way it was designed for and I would check for any new vulnerabilites by running another dependency check on the the code after being refacotred.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  Again going back to the OWASP Denependy check as its a simple method to check for any vulnerabilities in the system.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  For future employers, I would showcase the vulnerabilitiy reports that were generated and also show the refactored code.
